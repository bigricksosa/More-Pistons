## 🌐 Introducing More Pistons 1.20
The iconic mod by MontyPylon recreated to run on modern versions of Minecraft.

Extend and retract up to four blocks away! Pistons are colored to make them easily distinguishable. Crafting is simple, as the recipes follow traditional patterns and use relatively abundant resources to make.

All crafting recipes can be found [here](https://github.com/bigricksosa/More-Pistons/wiki/Crafting-Recipes).
## 📃 Features
### Seven New Pistons
- Double Piston
- Triple Piston 
- Quadruple Piston 
- Gravitational Piston 
- Sticky Double Piston
- Sticky Triple Piston

### Piston Launching Mechanics
Gravitational pistons are capable of launching all entities and falling blocks.\
This includes but is not limited to:
- Players
- Animals
- Mobs

Larger mobs require multiple pistons to launch. Additionally, pistons will stack their launch momentum if multiple are triggered simultaneously.
